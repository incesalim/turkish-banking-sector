# Architecture

End-to-end cloud stack. Ingestion runs in GitHub Actions; storage is
Cloudflare R2 + D1; display is Next.js on Cloudflare Workers. No local
machine is involved in the production data flow.

## Data flow

The complete-document corpus is an additional, separate audit output under
`document-corpus/v1/` in the audit R2 bucket. `build-document-corpus.yml` preserves
original PDF bytes and versioned page evidence, indexed by filing with retained
revisions and named failures. It does not publish analytical rows or replace the
existing capture database. Source preservation, structural extraction and semantic
verification are separate states; the active work is tracked in
[AUDIT_DOCUMENT_PLAN.md](AUDIT_DOCUMENT_PLAN.md).

## Components

| Layer | Path | Tech |
|---|---|---|
| **BDDK scrapers** | `src/scrapers/` | Python — monthly + weekly bulletins |
| **EVDS client + scraper** | `src/scrapers/evds_client.py`, `evds_scraper.py` | TCMB EVDS v3 HTTP client |
| **TBB digital-banking** | `src/tbb/` | Python — quarterly `.xls`/`.xlsx` workbook → tidy `tbb_digital_stats` |
| **TKBB participation digital** | `src/tkbb/` | Python — TKBB Veri Peteği (Turboard JSON API) → `tkbb_digital_stats`, `tkbb_acquisition_stats` |
| **TEFAS fund market** | `src/tefas/` | Python — rate-limited tefas.gov.tr JSON client → per-day sector aggregates in `tefas_*` (per-fund rows not persisted) |
| **KAP ownership** | `src/kap/` | Python — KAP Genel Bilgi Formu §5 + §7 → `kap_ownership` (weekly full replace) |
| **News + regulations** | `src/news/` | Python — KAP / TCMB / BDDK / press / Google News → `news_items`; free-LLM clients (`free_llm.py`, `kimi.py`) for "The Read" + `regulation_briefings` |
| **Earnings calendar** | `src/earnings/` | Python — KAP results filings + IR presentation decks → `bank_earnings` |
| **Franchise (annual reports)** | `src/faaliyet/` | Python — Faaliyet Raporu PDFs → `faaliyet_franchise`, `faaliyet_extractions` |
| **Non-bank lenders** | `src/nonbank/` | Python — BDDK non-bank monthly bulletin → `nonbank_balance_sheet` |
| **Advertised rates** | `src/rates/` | Python — doviz.com (loans) + hangikredi (deposits) → `bank_advertised_rates`; the only **per-bank** rate source (EVDS/BDDK publish rates at sector level only) |
| **TÜİK tables** | `src/tuik/` | Python — veriportali cookie-session → `.xls` downloads (series EVDS lacks) |
| **Audit-report extraction** | `src/audit_reports/` | **PyMuPDF (fitz) only** for every lane — pdfplumber was removed entirely on 2026-07-15 (the frozen BS/P&L `extractor.py`, `profiler.py`, and `src/faaliyet/extractor.py`, the last holdouts, moved to `_fitz_page_text`, a strict superset of the old pdfplumber layout-repair). `_fitz_page_text` is the single text reader; don't add another PDF engine. See `docs/AUDIT_EXTRACTION_GUIDE.md` |
| **R2 wrapper** | `src/audit_reports/r2_storage.py` | boto3 against S3-compatible R2 |
| **D1 sync** | `scripts/push_to_d1.py` | incremental push via wrangler. Audit lanes pass `--table-set audit` — the table list is derived from `src/audit_reports/registry.py`, never hand-written (a hand-written copy is what silently kept `bank_audit_fx_position`/`_repricing` out of D1) |
| **Edge database** | Cloudflare D1 (`bddk-data`) | SQLite at the edge, ~1.6M rows |
| **PDF storage** | Cloudflare R2 (`bddk-audit-reports`) | ~2.2 GB; **~1,100 quarterly PDFs** extracted across the 38-bank universe (1,093 extractions as of 2026-08-13; the 2026Q2 season is filling in) |
| **Dashboard** | `web/` | Next.js 16 + OpenNext + Recharts (charts) + d3-force (/ownership network layout) on Cloudflare Workers |
| **Mobile app** | `mobile/` | Expo SDK 57 + expo-router + React Native 0.86 + react-native-svg. Read-only native client over `/api/app/v1` — see § Mobile app |
| **Q&A bot (Telegram)** | `web/app/lib/bot.ts` + `web/app/api/telegram/webhook/` | public Q&A over the same D1: agent loop behind a read-only SQL gate + grounding guard — see [TELEGRAM_BOT.md](TELEGRAM_BOT.md) |
| **Read cache** | Cloudflare KV (`NEXT_INC_CACHE_KV`) | 1h data cache for D1 reads (`cachedAll` → `unstable_cache`) |
| **Admin panel** | `web/app/admin/`, `web/app/api/admin/` | password-gated control center: data health, refresh triggers, traffic |
| **Quality gates** | `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `pyproject.toml`, `tests/` | ruff + pytest + eslint + tsc + vitest on every PR |
| **Schema migrations** | `web/migrations/` | hand-authored, version-controlled; applied via `wrangler d1 migrations apply` on deploy |

## Workflows

The ingestion workflows split along **two independent storage lanes**, so a
failure in one can't stall the other:

| Lane | Staging DB | R2 snapshot | Concurrency group |
|---|---|---|---|
| BDDK bulletins + EVDS | `data/bddk_data.db` | `state/bddk_data.db.gz` | `bddk-pipeline` |
| Bank audit reports | `data/bank_audit.db` | `state/bank_audit.db.gz` | `bddk-audit` |

> The whole topology — sources → these workflows → D1/R2/KV → dashboard pages,
> with the two lanes banded apart — is visualized interactively on the **`/pipeline`**
> tab (React Flow; storage nodes show live D1 row counts + freshness, workflow nodes
> their last GitHub Actions run). Source of truth: `web/app/lib/pipeline-graph.ts`.

The two lanes share no snapshot, so the audit workflow runs in parallel with
the bulletin/EVDS workflows. Their only shared sink is D1, where they write a
**disjoint** set of tables (`bank_audit_*` vs everything else) with idempotent
`INSERT OR REPLACE`.

**Most tables sync incrementally** (a time-windowed `INSERT OR REPLACE`). Two of
the coverage-matrix **spine** tables — `bank_audit_expected` /
`bank_audit_statement_types` — are **full-rebuild**: `push_to_d1.py` emits
`DELETE FROM <t>; INSERT …` from the local copy, because those rows are computed
wholesale by `sync_audit_expected.py` (no per-row timestamp). The third,
`bank_audit_coverage`, left full-rebuild on **2026-08-06**
(`_COVERAGE_INCREMENTAL` in `push_to_d1.py`): its cells are windowed on
`derived_at` (migration 0040) and removals travel through the
`d1_pending_deletes` outbox, so a change ships only the cells it moved instead
of restating all ~20,000 rows. Full-rebuild is the one place the shared-D1
design has a footgun: those tables are only populated in `bank_audit.db`; in
`bddk_data.db` they're created-but-empty, so a daily news/EVDS push from the
bulletin lane would `DELETE` the spine and insert nothing — **wiping the /admin
coverage matrix** even though the audit lane never ran. The guard:
`push_to_d1.fetch_recent` **skips a full-rebuild table whose local copy is empty**,
so a push can never wipe a table it has no rows for. (Recovery recipe in
[OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md) → Troubleshooting.)

One audit table is **derived, not extracted**: `bank_audit_stages` is built from
`bank_audit_credit_quality` (Stage-1/2 loan amounts + the BRSA NPL Stage-3 +
ECLs) by `scripts/build_bank_audit_stages.py`. So re-extracting `credit_quality`
must **rebuild stages**. The routine audit workflow rebuilds afterward; targeted
re-extraction rebuilds the affected partition inside the candidate savepoint,
before acceptance, so source and derived rows cannot disagree after a repair.

The P&L role map (`bank_audit_pl_roles`) is derived too: every P&L persistence
path rebuilds it from the stored statement, and targeted P&L repair includes
the map in its transaction and table-scoped push. The manual
`repair-audit-roles.yml` compares maps with live D1 and restores only differing
partitions after checking source agreement; it never re-extracts or writes a
financial figure. A repeat run is read-only when D1 and the snapshot agree.

The manual `repair-missing-audit-rows.yml` recovers rows lost from D1 while the
authoritative R2 audit snapshot still retains them. It preflights every selected
table before writing, requires live facts to be an exact subset of source facts,
and replaces only the affected table partitions. It preserves source timestamps,
verifies restored values and a no-op second comparison, then saves updated push
digests. It does not extract PDFs or resolve conflicting figures. Incremental
sync selects partition keys by timestamp but hashes and sends each complete
partition; an absent timestamp-window entry never proves that a partition is empty.

### Daily — `.github/workflows/refresh-evds-daily.yml`
Sun–Fri 05:00 UTC. Polls only EVDS series declared daily/workday, keeping FX,
policy/funding rates and sterilization current within 24h. Weekly, monthly and
quarterly EVDS series are polled by Saturday's full refresh. Every unrelated
`refresh.py` lane is explicitly skipped, and a byte-stable DB result skips the
D1 push and R2 upload. A separate daily job, `refresh-news-daily.yml` (04:00 UTC),
refreshes `news_items`.

### BDDK bulletins — `.github/workflows/refresh-bddk-bulletins.yml`
Isolated BDDK-only refresh (`--skip-evds`, no audit), split by schedule via
`github.event.schedule`:
- **13:00 UTC on the first and last five days** — monthly check around BDDK's
  normal month-end publication window. `update_monthly.py` still probe-then-fetches.
- **Friday 13:30 + 15:30 UTC** (16:30 & 18:30 Turkey) — weekly. BDDK publishes the
  weekly bulletin Friday afternoon; two runs bracket the window (~30 min).

The former Saturday 02:00 backstop is removed: the full Saturday workflow runs
at 03:00. Quiet runs stop before D1 and R2.

A positive Telegram ping ("published & fetched", `notify_new_bddk.py`) fires when
a weekly/monthly period newly lands; quiet otherwise.

### Weekly full — `.github/workflows/refresh-data.yml`
Saturday 03:00 UTC. BDDK bulletins + EVDS + TBB digital + TKBB participation
digital + KAP + TEFAS + Faaliyet franchise:
1. Decompress `state/bddk_data.db.gz` (pulled from R2) → `data/bddk_data.db`
2. `scripts/refresh.py` — monthly + weekly + EVDS scrapes + TBB quarterly
   digital-banking refresh + KAP ownership + TEFAS fund market into SQLite
   (TBB/KAP/TEFAS are non-critical steps; an outage in one won't abort the
   BDDK refresh)
3. If SQLite is unchanged, stop. Otherwise `scripts/push_to_d1.py --hours 168`
   pushes the week's rows to D1
   (idempotent via INSERT OR REPLACE; covers `tbb_digital_stats`,
   `kap_ownership` and the `tefas_*` tables too)
4. VACUUM + re-gzip + upload the snapshot back to R2

### The satellite lanes — small, scheduled, one table each
Four crons ride the bulletin lane's snapshot and concurrency group, each writing a
single table. They're listed here because a lane nobody documents is a lane nobody
knows is running:

| Workflow | When | Writes |
|---|---|---|
| `refresh-advertised-rates.yml` | Mon 06:00 UTC | `python -m src.rates.scraper` → `bank_advertised_rates` (per-bank posted loan/deposit rates; the sources only expose "today", so history accretes forward) |
| `refresh-calendar.yml` | 1st of month 06:00 UTC | `python -m src.release_calendar.scraper` → `release_calendar` (TCMB's published calendar — MPC decisions/minutes, Inflation Report, Financial Stability Report; feeds the Ahead strips, retires the hand-typed `MPC_DATES`) |
| `refresh-presentations-weekly.yml` | Sat 06:00 UTC | `update_presentations.py` → `bank_earnings` (IR presentation decks) |
| `refresh-transcripts-weekly.yml` | manual (no cron yet) | `update_transcripts.py` → `bank_call_transcripts` (earnings-call transcripts, 8 listed banks). Ships without a `schedule:` and with `push` defaulting to false — a posture from the 2026-08-01 write freeze; the freeze has lifted, and turning the cron/push on is a decision not yet taken |
| `summarize-regulations.yml` | Sun 06:00 UTC | `summarize_regulations.py` → `regulation_briefings` (weekly Kimi briefing; needs `KIMI_API_TOKEN`) |
| `generate-reads.yml` | Sun 07:30 UTC | `generate_read_headlines.py` → `read_headlines` (free-LLM rewrite of the one-sentence lead on each T1 tab; number-validated, and shown only while its `det_hash` matches the live page) |

Seven more workflows are **manual dispatch only**. Six exist to load or strengthen
history, not to keep it fresh: `backfill-audit.yml`,
`backfill-audit-source-capture.yml`, `backfill-document-capture.yml`,
`backfill-faaliyet.yml`,
`backfill-nonbank.yml` and `backfill-tefas.yml`. The seventh,
`repair-loans-zeros.yml`, is a one-time idempotent correction — it re-derives the
zeros `_save_loans` discarded (falsy `or` chains turned every reported 0 into
NULL) from the raw responses already on disk. Recipes in
[OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md).

### Audit reports — one automatic path, one manual diagnostic
Standalone audit pipeline on its own DB + snapshot. `refresh-audit.yml` runs
daily only during filing windows and remains manually dispatchable:
1. Pull/seed `data/bank_audit.db`
2. Discover/download new PDFs and extract pending PDFs from R2 (or `--only-bank`
   / `--periods … --force` for a targeted re-extract, passed via the workflow's
   `bank`/`period` inputs from the /admin coverage matrix)
3. If nothing changed, stop with no D1 or snapshot write
4. Build stages, revalidate and rebuild the coverage spine locally
5. One `push_to_d1.py --table-set audit-refresh` batch (registry tables + spine)
6. VACUUM + re-gzip + upload `state/bank_audit.db.gz` (the snapshot WRITER)

`acquire-audit.yml` is now manual-only: an acquisition-only diagnostic for an
operator who deliberately wants a PDF in R2 without running extraction. Both
workflows share `bddk-audit`, so they cannot overlap.

**`reextract-statement.yml`** (dispatch-only) — targeted **single-statement** fix
on the same lane. Registry keys resolve to the extractor token, source table and
complete validation gate. `only_failing=true` selects a partition when any required
relationship is not a proven pass; `require_passing=true` accepts a candidate only
after all required results pass. Balance-sheet repairs require both internal
hierarchies plus A=L+E; credit-quality repairs rebuild and validate stages inside the
same savepoint. Rejected source, derived and validation rows roll back together, and
only factually changed tables are pushed. This is how OCI/CF/NPL/loans_by_stage were
fixed fleet-wide without re-running the frozen BS/P&L extraction.

**`backfill-audit-source-capture.yml`** (dispatch-only) — the evidence-only
historical upgrade for eight normalized/summary lanes. It downloads the existing
R2 PDFs, stores their bounded disclosure-page lines in the local/R2 snapshot, and
pushes only a compact source-count/hash manifest plus changed validation rows to
D1. It never calls an analytical upsert. Near-full lanes fail on an unknown numeric
source row; selected-summary lanes retain/count their intentionally omitted detail.
New extracts do this in the normal transaction; this workflow only closes the
historical gap.

**`backfill-document-capture.yml`** (dispatch-only) — the same idea taken from
lane-scoped to **document-scoped**. It reads every page of every filing and
records each table the bank prints — rows, inferred columns, cells — plus the
footnotes that qualify them, linked to the rows carrying their marker. Its point
is that a table nobody has written a parser for yet is captured anyway, so
adding a lane later is a query against the ledger instead of a fleet re-read of
1,050 PDFs. It writes no analytical row, so it is safe over the settled BS/P&L.
The ledger (5.4M lines / 11.2M cells, measured over the full fleet 2026-08-13)
goes to its own R2 object and its own
local `data/bank_audit_capture.db`, never into the audit snapshot that every
workflow downloads; only `bank_audit_document_manifest` — one row per filing —
reaches D1.

**`measure-free-provision.yml`** (dispatch-only) — the same read-only posture,
aimed at one extractor. It downloads every audit PDF from R2, re-runs
`classify_free_provision`, and diffs the result against the values already in
the snapshot; the diff returns as an artifact and nothing is written anywhere.
It exists because a *page-selection* change is corpus-wide by construction: the
defect that prompted it made TEB 2026Q1 store a free provision of 0 while the
filing states ₺1,108,135k, because the classifier read a later reversal note
whose prior-period parenthetical said `Bulunmamaktadır`. Two more partitions
carried the same fingerprint. Knowing which cells a fix moves — and that it
moves no others — has to come before any re-extraction is authorised.

**`audit-triage.yml`** (dispatch-only) — the *diagnosis* half of the same lane,
and the only one that writes nothing at all. The validator records which identity
broke; `src/audit_reports/triage.py` works out why, by comparing the stored rows
against what the filing actually prints and assigning one of a fixed set of
mechanical causes — a column the extractor never read, a row it never extracted, a
value taken from the wrong column, a cell word-wrapped out of reach, a missed
anchor, a drawn page, a rotated page, the wrong PDF, a unit change, or a source
that genuinely does not foot. Deterministic throughout: no model is consulted and
no figure is produced, so a verdict is a hypothesis with its evidence attached
rather than an assertion. Its companion `scripts/watch_cross_period.py` compares
each partition with the same bank one quarter earlier, which is the only place a
reporting-unit change can be seen — every in-filing identity is a ratio of figures
sharing a scale, so all of them foot when the whole filing moves by 1000×.

**`analyst-daily.yml`** (dispatch-only — the intended daily cron is wired but
commented out; turning it on is a decision not yet taken) — the analyst layer on
top of the same snapshot. Deterministic detectors
(`src/analyst/` — reporting-unit switches, cross-period restatements the
validators deliberately skip-list, opinion-type/category changes via the
basis-text classifier, perimeter changes, and the two
headline-conceals-composition divergences: CAR−CET1 and NPL-vs-coverage), then
per-bank memos: `web/app/lib/analyst/` assembles an 11-section deterministic
view (with the mix-vs-erosion coverage decomposition precomputed), a free-model
LLM writes connective prose, and the bot's figure guard drops any paragraph
whose numbers are not in the data it was shown. Migration
`0037_analyst_signals.sql` is **applied** — `analyst_signals` (455 rows),
`analyst_basis_metadata` (1,050) and `analyst_notes` (2) are live in D1 — and
the workflow carries a D1 push step gated on its `push` input (off by default;
staging in `data/analyst.db`, persisted to R2 as `state/analyst.db.gz`).
Without `push`, signals + memos leave as run artifacts only. (The 2026-08-01
write freeze that originally forced artifacts-only has lifted.)

**`analyst-research.yml`** (dispatch-only, artifact-only, evaluation phase) —
Analyst V2: agentic discovery over deterministic evidence. A story-agnostic
scout surfaces what moved (per-row deltas, own-history z-scores, reconciliation
breaks); a bounded research loop lets the model investigate through typed
read-only tools (full statement matrices, row histories, cross-statement
reconciliations, filing-page text) building a hypothesis ledger; findings are
STRUCTURED claims with evidence ids; a deterministic verifier checks entity/
period/kind association, comparison direction, arithmetic, contradictions,
causal-language and forecast policy — beyond V1's lexical guard. Nothing
reaches D1; abstention is a first-class outcome. Contracts and limitations:
[ANALYST_V2.md](ANALYST_V2.md).

**`purge-partition.yml`** (dispatch-only) — the inverse operation: removes one
`(bank, period[, kind])` from the lane via `scripts/purge_partition.py`, in the
one order that makes it stick — pull snapshot → delete locally → delete in D1 →
**re-upload the snapshot**. Clearing D1 alone does not hold: the snapshot keeps
the rows and the next `push_to_d1` from any later extraction restores them. The
R2 **PDF is left in place**, so the coverage cell returns to `missing` *with*
`pdf_present` — "acquired, awaiting extraction" — and a re-extract brings it back.

It exists for the failure mode no validator can reach: an extraction that is
internally consistent and still wrong. **TEB's 2026Q2 filing switched its
reporting unit from thousands to millions of TL**, so every figure landed 1000×
too small — and because uniform scaling cancels on both sides of every internal
identity (assets = liabilities, subtotal = Σchildren), the balance sheet and P&L
validated *green*. Only `fx_cross_period`, which anchors the prior column against
the independently extracted prior year-end, went red. The lesson generalises: **no
internal identity can detect a unit change; only a cross-period or external anchor
can.**

### Deploy — `.github/workflows/deploy-cloudflare.yml`
**After CI passes on the same commit** (`workflow_run` on `CI`, `conclusion ==
success`, push events on `master`). Applies D1 migrations (`wrangler d1
migrations apply`), builds the OpenNext bundle, and deploys to Cloudflare
Workers.

Until 2026-08-01 this was `on: push` with a `paths:` filter, which meant it
*raced* CI rather than waiting for it — no `needs:`, no branch protection, so a
red CI did not stop a deploy and the D1 migration step ran before any check had
passed. `workflow_run` carries no path filter, so the deploy now builds on every
green CI on master rather than only on `web/**` changes: a few minutes of free
Actions time, traded for never shipping unchecked, and never silently skipping.

### Health check — `.github/workflows/healthcheck.yml`
Daily 06:00 UTC. Queries D1 freshness per source + audit failure count and
alerts (`scripts/notify.py` → Telegram/Discord) when data is stale or
extractions spike. Also asserts the Q&A bot's Telegram webhook still points at
the live origin — Telegram keeps delivering to whatever URL it was last given,
so the bot can go silent with nothing failing on our side.

### Telegram webhook — `.github/workflows/telegram-webhook.yml`
Manual only. `set` / `info` / `check` for the Q&A bot webhook
(`scripts/setup_telegram_webhook.py`). In CI because `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and
`TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` aren't available locally. Re-run `set` after anything
that moves the site origin.

### CI — `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
On every PR (and master push): Python `ruff` + `pytest`; web `eslint` + `tsc` +
`vitest` (`npm run test` — unit tests for pure lib code, e.g.
`app/lib/pl-sankey.test.ts`); and mobile `eslint` + `tsc` + `check:tokens` +
a Metro bundle. Dependency updates come via `.github/dependabot.yml`
(pip / npm / github-actions, weekly).

## Mobile app

`mobile/` is an Expo (React Native) client for iOS and Android. It is a **second
view of the same data**, not a second pipeline: it reads `/api/app/v1` on the
same Worker, which reads the same D1 through the same `web/app/lib/` query
modules the website renders from.

### Why a private API rather than `/api/v1`

`/api/v1` is a published product surface — a documented series contract that
third parties build against, so its shapes can only ever be added to.
`/api/app/v1` is the private wire format between our own Worker and our own
client: screen-oriented, denormalised, and free to change whenever a screen
changes. Keeping them apart is what lets the app iterate without freezing the
public API.

| Endpoint | Screen | Reuses |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/app/v1` | launch handshake (`minSupportedClient`) | — (no D1 read on the launch path) |
| `GET /api/app/v1/overview` | Overview | `metrics.ts`, `desk.ts`, `insights.ts`, `audit-ratios.ts`, `real-terms.ts`, `ahead-data.ts` |
| — | *(no market tape)* | `market-ticker.ts` is deliberately **not** called here — Yahoo terms forbid redistribution, which a store listing makes formal. USD/TRY comes from EVDS `TP.DK.USD.A` instead. Website unaffected. |
| `GET /api/app/v1/banks` | Banks index | `heatmap.ts`, `audit.ts`, `bank_names.ts` |
| `GET /api/app/v1/banks/{ticker}` | Bank detail | `heatmap.ts`, `audit.ts`, `news.ts` |
| `GET /api/app/v1/economy` | Economy | `economy.ts` |
| `GET /api/app/v1/news` | News | `news.ts` |

Kill switch: `APP_API_DISABLED=1` on the Worker. **Separate** from
`PUBLIC_API_DISABLED` on purpose — that one sheds third-party load in an
incident, and reusing it would black out every installed app at the same moment.

### The invariant that matters

**No metric is derived in the app.** Every ratio, deflation and streak is
computed server-side by the same `web/app/lib` function the website calls, so
the two surfaces cannot print different values for the same metric. The client
formats (`mobile/src/format.ts`) and writes copy around figures; it never makes
them. A new number goes into `web/app/lib` first.

### Deliberate divergences from the website

- **Four tabs, not ~30 routes.** Overview / Banks / Economy / News. The depth
  routes (`/capital`, `/liquidity`, `/cross-bank`, `/regulation`, `/pipeline`)
  stay on the web, and each screen links out.
- **The sheet is the screen.** The Desk's white-sheet-on-paper figure-ground
  needs margins the phone doesn't have, so `card` becomes the screen fill —
  which is what the website itself already does below the `lg` breakpoint.
- **Single-series charts only.** Partly because a multi-series line chart is
  unreadable at 390pt, and partly because the categorical ramp fails the
  colorblind check in dark mode (`--chart-2` vs `--chart-1` scores ΔE 6.1 for
  *normal* vision, below the 15 floor). The website gets away with it via
  direct-labelled chart feet; a phone chart has no room for one. See
  PROJECT_STATE.md § Known issues.
- **Payloads are trimmed server-side.** Sparklines ship 13 points, metric trends
  8 quarters, macro series 48 months. Full history stays on the web.

### ⚠️ `heatmapPanel()` is a RANKING, not the universe

`heatmapPanel()` refuses to hold a peer-excluded bank at all — `ensure()` hands
those callers a throwaway row, because every rank, colour scale and percentile
downstream is computed off that map. Building the bank index off it dropped
Takasbank from the app entirely and 404'd a bank the website lists and serves a
full page for.

The spine of any *universe* query is `bankSummaries()` (unfiltered); ratios are
left-joined from the panel where they exist. `/api/app/v1/banks` returns both
`count` (38, the universe) and `peers` (37, the rankable subset) so a client
cannot rank off the wrong one, and `/banks/{ticker}` carries
`scorecardAvailable` + `scorecardNote` so an absent ratio prints its reason
rather than an em dash that reads as a blank filing.

### Theme tokens

`mobile/src/theme/tokens.ts` is a hand-copy of `web/app/globals.css` (React
Native cannot read a CSS custom property). `mobile/scripts/check-tokens.mjs`
re-reads the CSS and fails CI on any divergence, so the two copies cannot drift.

## Why the SQLite snapshot exists

The cron pipeline uses a local SQLite as a staging area between scrapers
and D1 (it's cheap to query, supports complex SQL the scrapers expect,
and gives us a backup of the canonical numbers). After each run the
gzipped snapshot is uploaded to R2 so the next cron starts from the last
known state without re-scraping from scratch.

The two ingestion lanes persist one snapshot each: the bulletin/EVDS lane
`state/bddk_data.db.gz` (~55 MB) and the audit lane `state/bank_audit.db.gz`
(the `bank_audit_*` tables only). The audit lane bootstraps its snapshot on
first run by seeding from the bulletin snapshot (`scripts/seed_audit_db.py`)
rather than re-extracting every PDF.

Three more staging stores sit beside the two lane snapshots, each with its own
persistence posture: `data/analyst.db` (analyst-lane state — signals + memo
hashes — rides R2 as `state/analyst.db.gz`), `data/bank_audit_capture.db` (the
full-document capture ledger — its own R2 object, never the audit snapshot;
only the one-row-per-filing manifest reaches D1), and
`data/bank_audit_prose.db` (the 369k-row historical prose backfill —
local-only, not yet merged or pushed).

Production dashboard reads go to D1, not this snapshot — the R2 copy is
purely pipeline state.

**Backups & recovery (free):** each run also writes a dated copy
`state/history/<lane>-YYYYMMDD.db.gz` and keeps the last 7, so a corrupt run
can't destroy the only snapshot. For the serving DB, D1 **Time Travel** gives a
7-day point-in-time restore. See [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md) → Disaster recovery.

## Dashboard read caching

Dashboard pages are dynamic (server-rendered per request), but the D1 queries
behind them are cached: `web/app/lib/db.ts` `cachedAll()` wraps reads in
`unstable_cache` (1h TTL — it was 12h to stay under the free tier's 1,000 KV
writes/day; the paid plan's 1M/month allowance removed that constraint, so the
window was cut 12× for fresher pages), keyed by SQL + params and backed by the
`NEXT_INC_CACHE_KV` namespace via OpenNext's incremental cache
(`open-next.config.ts`). The hot `metrics.ts` query helpers route through it, so
identical queries hit D1 at most once per hour instead of on every page view —
cutting D1 rows-read sharply.

Pages stay dynamic on purpose: page-level ISR (`export const revalidate`) would
prerender the data pages at build time, which queries D1 against the empty
build-time DB and fails. Caching the *data* (not the page) avoids that. `/admin`
is intentionally uncached (auth-gated + shows live pipeline status).

The `/ownership` sector graph is built server-side off two cached queries
(`sectorOwnership()` in `web/app/lib/kap.ts` for the graph, `bankSummaries()`
for asset-based node sizing — fail-soft to uniform sizes). The force-directed
layout (d3-force, `web/app/lib/ownership-force.ts`) runs synchronously in a
`useMemo` with seeded positions and a seeded random source, so the server
render and client hydration agree; all interaction (zoom, ego-highlighting,
focus, tooltips) is client-side on the serialized graph, so clicking around
costs zero extra D1 reads.

For local dev, `web/next.config.ts` calls `initOpenNextCloudflareForDev()` so
`next dev` resolves the D1/KV bindings against the local wrangler/miniflare
state — seed tables with `npx wrangler d1 execute bddk-data --local --file …`
to work on data pages offline.

## Admin control center

A password-gated `/admin` route (see [ADMIN.md](ADMIN.md)) surfaces data-freshness
per source, audit-extraction failures, GitHub workflow run status + manual
triggers, and Cloudflare Web Analytics — reading D1 plus the GitHub/Cloudflare
APIs through route handlers under `web/app/api/admin/`.
