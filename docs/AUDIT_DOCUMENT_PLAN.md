# Complete audit document corpus

Status: active implementation, begun 2026-09-06.

## Objective and scope

Preserve every table and every text passage in the registered bank audit-report
corpus, across banks, periods and reporting bases. Preserve source structure,
provenance and qualifications so tables can later become website time series
and narrative can support analyst research. Complete the registered corpus
first; expand to additional banks and earlier history afterward (user decision,
2026-09-06).

Existing task reports, successful jobs, extracted counts and internal accounting
identities are not evidence that the source was captured completely. Verify
against original PDFs and independently annotated source cases. No filing is
described as fully verified while any content region or required check remains
unresolved. Source contradictions are retained and flagged, never silently fixed
in the transcription layer.

The concurrent release-pipeline task owns the currently modified workflows,
`src/pipeline/`, release scripts and its migration. Keep this implementation
separate; do not stage or overwrite that task's changes.

## Verified starting observations

- Live R2 listing on 2026-09-06: 1,117 audit PDF objects, 38 banks,
  2022Q1 through 2026Q2. This counts acquired objects, not independently expected
  filings. The registered URL set and acquisition inventory must be reconciled.
- The local legacy capture has 1,095 filings. It cannot be accepted as the
  current corpus and does not store a PDF byte hash or extraction version.
- Routine `refresh-audit` captures a run-local ledger and discards it. The
  durable fleet ledger is written by a separate manual backfill. Detailed new
  filings therefore do not automatically accumulate in durable capture storage.
- The admin coverage matrix describes predefined analytical lanes. It does not
  establish whole-document capture coverage or show source-level verification.
- The legacy capture retains text lines and numerical table geometry; pure text
  tables and image/vector content require explicit handling. Successful numeric
  parsing does not establish preservation of all textual relationships.
- A source-verified QNB example preserves both printed percentages correctly
  but assigns an incorrect analytical role. Literal transcription and financial
  interpretation need separately testable contracts.

## Work sequence and acceptance

1. **Corpus inventory and immutable source identity.** Reconcile registered
   filings, acquisition objects and local inputs. Store original URL/object key,
   PDF SHA-256, byte count, bank/period/basis and revision association. Record
   missing sources and conflicting identities explicitly. Completeness must
   have a denominator independent of successful extraction.
2. **Independent source evidence and benchmark.** Preserve PyMuPDF source text
   and geometry without routing it through the existing table detector. Account
   for every text token, including duplicate occurrences, and every nontext
   region. Construct source-annotated real-PDF cases covering languages,
   rotation, wrapped and multi-page tables, prose, footnotes, text-only tables,
   outlines and scans. Verify the check itself with dropped/swapped content.
3. **Complete structured document representation.** Preserve document order,
   sections and nested headings; tables with row/column headers, original cell
   text and spans; paragraphs/lists; notes and references; page and bounding-box
   provenance; extraction method and explicit ambiguity. Keep residual content
   accessible. OCR/vision recovery must preserve source evidence and remain
   unverified until independently checked.
4. **Durable incremental processing.** Write per-source, versioned artifacts to
   R2; skip identical inputs and engine versions. Resume interrupted runs and
   retain failures. Rebuild searchable/structured views from those artifacts.
   Run fleet processing in Actions, keeping local execution to light probes
   and tests. A failed filing must not disappear behind a successful job total.
5. **Admin and analyst access.** Expose the expected/acquired/captured/verified
   distinction, stale versions, content gaps and source evidence in the admin
   panel. Provide queryable tables and structured prose with citations. Store
   large evidence in R2; limit D1 to useful indexes/status and approved derived
   data, with content comparison before writes.
6. **Corpus verification and series migration decision.** Run the independent
   checks across the registered corpus, investigate every unresolved class and
   publish an explicit readiness record. Verify new analytical questions against
   the source. Compare candidate series to current lanes by period, unit, basis
   and meaning; replace lanes only when the replacement has demonstrated the
   required coverage and correctness. Current serving lanes remain available
   during that comparison.

## Definition of done

Every expected filing has a traceable source or an evidenced acquisition gap.
Every acquired source version has durable, reproducible capture artifacts.
Every page's text and nontext content is accounted for. Every detected table,
paragraph and note is accessible with its source and structural context. Tests
exercise omission, duplication, misassociation, source changes and failed runs.
The admin view exposes unresolved work instead of collapsing it into a green
extraction status. Representative whole documents and new research questions
have been verified against rendered source pages, and remaining corpus issues
are enumerated. Completion is not inferred from a passing unit suite or a count
of detected tables.

## Execution record

- 2026-09-06: traced acquisition, capture, table derivation, prose, serving,
  admin coverage and workflow persistence. Confirmed first-stage scope with
  the user. Inspected live R2 object inventory read-only. Began independent
  inventory and source-evidence implementation.
- 2026-09-06: implemented immutable source evidence, source-bound candidate
  structure, per-filing R2 revision indexes and resumable publication. Candidate
  structure keeps all source text blocks, numeric table candidates, additional
  ruled text-only tables and nontext region references. Tests deliberately drop,
  duplicate, corrupt and swap content and interrupt uploads. None of these
  artifact-integrity checks certifies semantic completeness. Fleet publication,
  whole-document annotation and admin integration remain unfinished.
- 2026-09-06: visually verified QNB 2026Q1 solo PDF pages 45–46. Fixed the
  countercyclical-buffer role matcher to use the actual requirement row (0.01%),
  not a regulation reference inside the distinct 5.97% ratio. Added regression
  tests and reran the assembler; stored wide rows still require targeted rebuild.
- 2026-09-06: inspected the signed-in live admin panel. Its audit summary showed
  `Clean` while the lane matrix showed 39 error cells and all 1,117 prose cells
  unavailable. Changed the coarse summary wording to state its actual core
  extraction scope. The new corpus panel is still to be built.
- 2026-09-06: captured all 108 pages of QNB 2026Q1 solo into the new source
  representation; all typed text is conserved by the candidate lines. Source
  review of PDF page 47 found table rules made of thousands of raster dashes.
  Added candidate rule reconstruction and verified the resulting 23×3 mixed
  text table against the rendered PDF. Four independently annotated source
  cases pass; this is not a whole-document benchmark. Image/drawing review,
  table continuation and complete narrative semantics remain outstanding.
- 2026-09-06: Actions sample [34026793864](https://github.com/incesalim/Carthago/actions/runs/34026793864)
  preserved QNB 2026Q1 consolidated and solo: 218 pages, with original PDFs,
  evidence and candidate structure in eight R2 objects. Independently downloaded
  and verified the stored bytes and source accounting; the four annotated solo
  cases pass, while consolidated remains unannotated. CI exposed an unnecessary
  SDK import in offline storage tests; removed that dependency and tested the
  adapter with the SDK unavailable.
- 2026-09-06: identical replay [34027268957](https://github.com/incesalim/Carthago/actions/runs/34027268957)
  passed and left all ten stored objects unchanged, including ETag, byte count
  and modification time. Added a compact corpus catalog and private admin page
  viewer. Python-produced wire fixtures test exact page-byte compatibility with
  the Worker reader, plus dropped/changed pages, wrong sources and auth gating.
  Deployed at `8020250c` after green CI. Live admin checks confirmed source-bound
  page streaming, the QNB page-47 23×3 table, preserved prose and blocked anonymous
  downloads. Broader source-format verification remains pending.
- 2026-09-06: added resume receipts that bind already-verified bytes to their
  storage object versions; changed sources, engines, annotations, missing or
  changed artifacts and failed attempts invalidate reuse. Added full-byte replay
  and automatic corpus follow-up after the existing acquisition workflows.
  Cloud receipt replay [34029395716](https://github.com/incesalim/Carthago/actions/runs/34029395716)
  passed: both QNB filings reused object-version receipts, and all 15 stored
  objects remained unchanged. The first structure fleet was stopped after new
  source probes exposed two structural defects. Source-only fleet
  [34029735843](https://github.com/incesalim/Carthago/actions/runs/34029735843)
  is running while structure repairs are verified.
- 2026-09-06: source probes found Akbank 2026Q1 solo page 6's single-row
  ownership table was undetected, and Garanti 2022Q4 consolidated page 4's
  pension-table left border was pulled into its text by global snapping of the
  auditor logo's vector paths. Added conservative rule filtering and cell-width
  underline candidates. Independent annotations fail on the prior outputs and
  pass on the repaired pages. Also verified TOMK 2024Q1 page 7's wrapped director
  responsibilities. Seven selected source cases across four filings now pass;
  this still does not constitute whole-document semantic verification.
- 2026-09-06: Albaraka 2026Q1 solo PDF page 3 stores four titled audit passages
  and the signature in a single physical text block. Added source-line paragraph
  segmentation, heading candidates, explicit table-text membership and retained
  running furniture. Four manually transcribed full-paragraph digests check the
  qualifications, negations, repeated figures and heading associations against
  their source regions. Source accounting also rejects reordered, dropped or
  duplicated prose. The admin can show these candidates alongside raw blocks.
  Cloud probes and broader narrative/reading-order verification remain pending.
- 2026-09-06: cloud probes at `e842211c` passed Akbank, Garanti, QNB and TOMK's selected
  cases. The Albaraka whole-report probe correctly failed all four paragraph
  checks: larger cover typography leaked into the auditor opinion's heading
  path. The wording itself was intact. Reproduced the failure from the retained
  cloud artifact and corrected heading scope to the page, with document section
  context retained separately. The unchanged source annotations then pass.
  Cross-page paragraph/heading continuation remains an explicit later task;
  relative font size alone is insufficient evidence for that relationship.
- 2026-09-06: Albaraka replay `34031695563` passes all four unchanged paragraph
  annotations; independently checked its downloaded artifact. Across the cloud
  probes, all seven selected table cases and four prose cases now pass.
- 2026-09-06: stopped source-only fleet `34029735843` after 242 successful named
  outcomes. A further Akbank page-9 source check found that default page clipping
  truncates image replacement text (PDF ActualText), including the final footnote.
  Replacement geometry can also glue a heading to the preceding amount. Original
  PDFs remain intact. Source evidence now preserves an unbounded text view, a
  separate literal-glyph word view when they differ, and PDF-declared structure
  with source-span links and image regions. Native `Table` tags can be column
  strips, so they remain source metadata rather than assumed visual tables.
  Two new source cases gate both source-only capture and structured capture;
  their changes invalidate source receipts independently of table cases.
  The new evidence engine needs cloud validation before the fleet resumes.
- 2026-09-06: read-only source-format probes on FIBA 2025Q3 and ISCTR 2025Q1
  completed. They flag 40 unreadable pages in each FIBA filing and five in ISCTR
  consolidated (none in solo). These are detector flags, not a completed source
  review. Original images/vectors are preserved; OCR recovery and independent
  transcription checks remain outstanding.
- 2026-09-06: source-fidelity cloud probes at `9b1d9b84` pass all 13 selected
  table, prose and source-text cases. Published sample `34033192250` covers four
  Akbank/Albaraka filings and 374 pages. Independently downloaded their originals,
  evidence and structure: source/acquisition bytes, committed engine hashes,
  page accounting and all matching annotations pass. Live admin checks show the
  separated Albaraka opinion and complete Akbank footnote; the catalog correctly
  reports 238 stale captures among 242 preserved sources and zero fully verified
  filings. Added four stable filing groups for full Actions runs; tests verify
  exhaustive/disjoint assignment, global limit handling, explicit empty groups
  and safe catalog merging after three competing writers. This changes execution
  only; the source and structure engine fingerprints remain unchanged.
- 2026-09-06: CI for `b4fd60c9` passed. Bounded sample replay `34034349723`
  reused all four filings; independently checked all 21 source/corpus object
  versions were unchanged. Full run `34034440123` is active in four disjoint
  groups. The catalog retains its full 1,117-filing denominator and zero fully
  verified status while stale captures are replaced.
- 2026-09-06: visually confirmed FIBA 2025Q3 solo page 10's vector-only balance
  sheet and ISCTR 2025Q1 consolidated page 11's raster balance sheet. Full-page
  OCR recovered all 12 selected total-assets tokens in their correct regions.
  An isolated-cell probe read FIBA's 37.237.474 as 37.137.474; both disagreement
  and the row's arithmetic expose the error. Borders also become punctuation.
  Added separate, image-bearing OCR observations with pinned model and runtime
  identities, source-pixel verification and complete retained word/span checks.
  Local source probes and 12 token-region annotations pass, without approving
  cell signs, wording or whole tables. The workflow exposes only bounded,
  read-only OCR probes at this stage; cloud verification and production recovery
  integration remain outstanding.
- 2026-09-06: OCR cloud probes `34035657812` (FIBA) and `34035660589` (ISCTR)
  pass. Independently downloaded their originals, native evidence, OCR PDFs and
  observations; pixel/source retention and the 12 selected token-region checks
  pass. Comparing Windows and Actions outputs exposes differences outside those
  selected cases, including amounts. Raw OCR is retained as an observation.
- 2026-09-06: a vector-outline prototype on FIBA page 10 uses 24 transcribed
  numeric words and two dash styles as source anchors. It reconstructs 47 numeric
  rows (182 numbers, 100 dashes), with all 38 fully numeric TP+FC=total identities
  passing. On held-out page 11 it reads 274 entries and leaves eight parenthesized
  amounts unresolved, preserving the signs' uncertainty. Twelve independently
  transcribed deposit/total-liability region checks pass. Added a bounded,
  read-only outline probe with a source-rebuilt atlas and tests for reference
  mismatches, ambiguous glyphs, moved/changed words, and partial negative reads.
  The 26 selected word/region/abstention checks pass locally. Cloud validation,
  parentheses and additional fonts/characters remain outstanding; this does not
  certify complete table or prose semantics.
- 2026-09-06: outline cloud probe `34037621029` passes. Independently downloaded
  its original, source evidence, atlas and observations: the rebuilt atlas is
  identical and all 26 selected checks pass. Extended source seeds to learn only
  parentheses and a decimal comma; numeric templates remain from page 10. Eight
  previously unresolved page-11 negatives now require their exact signs. Twenty
  page-13 P&L values were visually transcribed before testing. All 46 selected
  words pass locally. One apparent miss was a test-region ambiguity caused by a
  whole-page background path: requiring whole-path containment resolves it
  without relaxing glyph matching. Cloud replay and durable recovery integration
  remain outstanding.
- 2026-09-06: punctuation replay `34038991010` and an independent download/source
  reconstruction pass all 46 selected outline checks. Implemented separate
  recovery publication, per-page history/failures, source-linked OCR lines and
  raw OCR/outline comparisons. Added a manual Actions recovery workflow and a
  private admin reader/viewer. Tests inject changed words, lost lines, source and
  page mismatches, missing/corrupt storage, interrupted uploads and false approval;
  repeated identical publication writes nothing. Production recovery, source
  classification coverage and broader table/prose associations remain pending.
- 2026-09-06: published recovery samples `34039939707` (three FIBA pages) and
  `34039941630` (one ISCTR page) pass. Independent R2 downloads reproduce original
  hashes, pixels, OCR observations, outline atlas/readings and annotations. Live
  admin displays both, including FIBA's 21/4/2 raw-reader differences; anonymous
  access returns 403. Source review confirms one material disagreement: interest
  received from banks is 717.417, which OCR read as 7.417. The outline read is
  correct; added a source regression without teaching new glyphs. Replaced the
  inherited selector's double-rotated page bounds with explicit display geometry
  and image-region word counts, tested at all four rotations. Changed recovery
  views now rebuild from retained raw observations without repeating OCR.
- 2026-09-06: refinement replay `34040563636` reuses all three selected OCR
  observations. Unchanged replay `34040764985` reuses them and leaves all 12
  checked object versions unchanged. Started full recovery `34040878532` in
  four groups, alongside the native capture fleet. Implemented a candidate
  table view from retained source pixels, thin vertical rules and repeated
  amount baselines. Local FIBA/ISCTR probes yield 47×8, 47×8, 64×6 and 48×8
  grids. All 59 method/region checks (53 annotated source locations) pass; tests
  deliberately swap/drop/duplicate/move source cells, alter image pixels and
  preserve unresolved signs and OCR `o` without inventing numeric zeros.
  Full raw observations remain accessible; table semantics and cloud layout
  validation are still outstanding.

- 2026-09-06: read-only recovery table probes `34042466701` (FIBA pages
  10/11/13) and `34042468735` (ISCTR page 11) pass at `7cd0cf88`; CI and
  deployment pass. Independent downloaded source-pixel, raw observation,
  source-built atlas and grid reconstruction checks pass all 59 selected
  cell associations. Windows NumPy 1.26.4 and Actions 2.5.2 produce identical
  grids; this cross-runtime check is recorded separately from engine identity.
  Whole-table interpretation and unannotated content remain unverified.
- 2026-09-06: added recovery filing receipts after byte readback of original,
  page artifacts and recovery index. Changed source versions, page failures,
  code/runtime/models, per-filing annotations or retained artifact versions
  invalidate the shortcut. Explicit and automatic page scopes are separate.
  Tests confirm a no-op replay reads only the receipt, recovery index and object metadata,
  writes nothing and runs no PDF processing; explicit byte recheck reuses raw
  OCR. These receipts still require a cloud replay proof before automatic
  recovery follow-up. The native and raw-recovery full runs remain active.

- 2026-09-06: independently rendered Akbank 2026Q1 solo page 9 confirms that
  replacement labels can inherit the preceding amount's text cursor. Literal
  glyphs alone fix numeric geometry but lose the image labels. A candidate view
  now uses only unique image/text siblings under a native Span, retains all
  original references and rejects ambiguous links. Native clipped image bounds
  must fit the observed image region. The selected page has 82 pairs and an
  86-row/six-value-column alternative. Three source-transcribed rows (18 values)
  and the complete footnote position pass, alongside the previous two page-9
  source cases. Unit tests reject changed/missing/duplicate associations and
  confirm display coordinates are transformed only once at all four rotations.
  Candidate structure and the admin table reader are integrated locally; source
  evidence stays unchanged. Cloud validation/publication remain pending.

- 2026-09-06: the four `5f6fd48` source-positioning cloud samples pass, as do
  CI and deployment. Independent downloaded bytes/source accounting verify
  543 retained pages and all 17 selected cases. Seven source pages are freshly
  observed from their original PDFs; the 82 Akbank page-9 position candidates
  and its alternative table rebuild identically. The cloud structure hash is
  checked against the committed files; local line-ending differences are
  recorded separately. Publishing sample `34045487439` is queued behind the
  native fleet. Completed native groups 0/1/2 independently match 840 expected
  filings and 87,258 pages, with no omitted, duplicate, unexpected or failed
  outcomes. Group 3 and the older raw-recovery fleet remain active.

- 2026-09-06: inspected the existing wrong-PDF helper: it tests only whether
  the cover contains the year and does not use the bank or quarter. Added a
  separate read-only source review with bank/date/basis claims and source span
  references, exact PDF/evidence/structure byte and page checks, suspicious-text
  signals and recovery gaps. Tests catch wrong quarters within the same year,
  wrong banks/bases, competing claims, missing pages and changed source bytes.
  Five retained original covers support their expected identity; a synthetic
  damaged-font example is flagged without treating ordinary numbers as bad
  text. The workflow quality mode never writes source or serving data. Fleet
  quality review remains pending.

- 2026-09-06: all four native groups completed and independently reconcile
  1,117 sources/116,503 pages without omissions, duplicates, unexpected outcomes
  or failures. Published Akbank/Albaraka positioned views match the independent
  probes byte-for-byte and pass live-admin review. Full read-only quality review
  34047832643 is active; three completed groups byte-verify 850 filings.
- 2026-09-06: independent BDDK register comparison across all 38 existing banks
  and 2022Q1–2026Q2 found 45 missing explicit URL bindings, including 29 PDFs not
  yet acquired. Corrected the registry to 1,146 filings without changing any
  existing URL. Opened official VakıfBank, Türkiye Kalkınma, Ziraat Dinamik and
  Takasbank source probes; the latter has a readable 78-page original and a
  damaged text layer. Added a separate optional missing-source acquisition step
  within the corpus workflow. It preserves original transport and PDF bytes,
  rejects ambiguous archive selection or conflicting cover identity, verifies
  conditional source creation, and leaves existing acquisitions unchanged.
  Eighteen acquisition tests cover failures, races, scope and no-write replay.
  Cloud publication and acquisition of the 29 gaps remain pending.

- 2026-09-06: full quality run 34047832643 completed. All four group reports
  independently match the original 1,117 acquired bindings and source hashes;
  both PDF copies and retained artifacts verify for all 116,503 pages. Leading
  source text supports 1,050 identities; 59 unresolved and eight ambiguous
  cases remain for review. These checks certify stored bytes and named source
  claims, not every printed character or table meaning.

- 2026-09-06: missing-source publishing sample 34049005525 passes. Takasbank and
  VakıfBank 2022Q1 newly acquired PDFs match separate official downloads; the
  existing VakıfBank solo acquisition retains its earlier hash/version. R2
  transport/manifest/PDF/evidence/structure bytes independently verify across
  292 selected pages. There are now 1,119 acquired filings and 27 registered
  gaps. Added an acquisition-before-capture job dependency so parallel groups
  cannot freeze different acquisition inventories while sources are arriving.

- 2026-09-06: expanded acquisition in 34049704430 names all 1,146 registered
  outcomes: 1,119 unchanged, 25 newly acquired, two held for review. Independent
  inspection explains both: Ziraat Dinamik has a Java-wrapped PDF inside a ZIP;
  Anadolubank has a 96-page report and a one-page signed responsibility statement.
  Added nested-wrapper provenance and exact filename/hash-bound reviewed archive
  selection. Unselected PDF members stay named/hashed with text capture pending.
  Publishing repairs remain queued work after the ongoing full native run.
- 2026-09-06: repaired artificial spaces at font-span boundaries in source
  identity review and added Ziraat's source-corroborated legal name. Reviewed
  Emlak, Vakıf Katılım and Ziraat covers now resolve; a contradictory Halkbank
  cover stays ambiguous. The old heuristic missed all four inspected damaged-text
  Takasbank pages. Nontext control-character signals now flag each, and automatic
  recovery selection includes these signals while preserving native observations.
  Tests cover controls, ordinary Turkish text, split font spans, explicit/automatic
  receipt scopes and a real PDF whose text layer contains control glyphs.

- Still required for source provenance: older `source_url` metadata is a registry
  lookup, not a fresh HTTP byte comparison. Stored-copy byte checks and opening
  identity claims do not establish that an older acquisition matches the current
  official published revision. Add an independent origin comparison and retain
  named mismatches/unavailable sources without overwriting historical originals.

- 2026-09-06: cloud source-identity repair sample supports all four selected
  covers; exact committed review-code hashes checked. Independently verified
  Takasbank's official PDF bytes, rendered pixels and raw recovery observations
  for pages 1/13. Its borderless balance sheet had no recovery table. Added a
  conservative amount-alignment fallback, preserving physical continuation rows
  and empty cells; 16 independently transcribed source amount regions pass.
  Added complete text-region comparisons and physical OCR blocks with table
  membership. Three of four source passages match; `İstanbul` versus OCR
  `Istanbul` stays explicitly different in the quality record and admin view.
  Recognition, whole-table structure and semantic coverage remain unapproved.

- 2026-09-06: independently reviewed all eight automatically ambiguous source
  identities against rendered originals. Five are contextual bank/prior-period
  mentions; three English covers contain genuine consolidated/unconsolidated
  contradictions while their auditor introductions identify consolidated reports.
  Added revision-bound contextual reviews with exact source span/text/geometry
  witnesses. They supplement automatic findings and cannot approve content or
  silently clear source contradictions. Local checks of all eight originals pass;
  cloud probes at `77c37cea` independently verify all eight reviews in 12 filings.
  Five covers now have automatic support after source font-span joins; three
  genuine cover contradictions remain explicit.

- 2026-09-06: completed the original raw-recovery fleet: 1,117 source bindings,
  184 filings with 741 selected pages and 289,865 OCR words; 933 filings with no
  image/outline pages flagged. Independent reconciliation matches every source
  hash against the verified native run. This does not establish selector recall.
  Published six FIBA/ISCTR/Takasbank sample pages; independently rechecked R2
  original/artifact bytes, pixels, observations and 75 selected table-cell checks.
  All three unchanged filing replays use receipts; 25 object versions are identical.
- 2026-09-06: introduced a separate source-bound embedded-font reading for empty
  Unicode maps. Unique source font/glyph/origin/fallback bindings retain raw text
  and alternatives; partial maps, duplicate bindings and ambiguous non-whitespace
  characters abstain. Source probes recover 60/1,571 Takasbank characters on
  pages 1/13 and pass all four independently transcribed complete text regions.
  The dotted İstanbul source reading is recovered while the OCR discrepancy stays
  visible. Tests cover real embedded fonts, subset-name truncation, four rotations,
  valid/partial/absent maps, ambiguous positions and mutated packets. Integrated
  derived-cache/receipt identity and admin alternatives; cloud probe pending.

- 2026-09-06: cloud font probe `34055586894` exactly matches source bytes,
  source pixels, retained OCR, the independently rebuilt font view and all four
  full text regions. Raw OCR is reused. Published packets at `34055751819` match
  that verified probe; CI/deploy at `0b43b2ef` pass.
- 2026-09-06: configured recovery after completed source capture. It downloads
  that same-repository run's reports, retains a manifest of successfully published
  filing/PDF hashes and names read-only/failed exclusions. Quality-only reports
  trigger no recovery. Workers process only the manifest, retain missing outcomes
  and reject changed PDFs before recovery or receipt reuse. Four or fewer filings
  stay one job; larger scopes use four stable groups. Tests cover scope omission,
  duplicate/conflicting bindings, changed source receipts and missing acquisitions.
  Automatic cloud execution remains pending; no D1 or analytical-lane writes.

- 2026-09-06: a live quality-only capture and automatic follow-up pass with an
  empty retained scope and recovery skipped; manual recovery still works. The
  positive publishing follow-up awaits the larger capture. Added independent
  official-origin comparison with exact downloaded/acquired byte checks, retained
  transport and PDF revisions, separate indexes, source identity findings and
  named unavailable/different outcomes. Matching wrong-period bytes still fail.
  Mutation, publication readback, grouped-scope and CLI tests pass; cloud source
  comparison pending. No acquired PDF or analytical row is replaced.

- 2026-09-06: independently verified four cloud origin probes at `2d0bbf2`: exact
  transport/PDF bytes, selected archive members, wrapper provenance, first-three
  page spans, committed implementation hashes and current acquisition bytes or
  absence. FIBA/Takasbank match; the two queued acquisition repairs stay missing.
  FIBA published transport/receipt/index matches the probe; the original object
  version is unchanged. Dispatched the full registered origin review. Added an
  authenticated admin comparison reader with receipt/artifact checksums, immutable
  filing/source bindings, explicit differences and links to retained source bytes.
  Python-produced wire tests exercise corrupt bytes, reminted wrong bindings,
  nonexistent comparisons and anonymous access; 719 web tests pass.

- 2026-09-06: the origin admin is deployed and independently checked for FIBA
  exact-byte agreement and Anadolubank's missing acquisition/pending signed PDF.
  Added separate archive-member document capture: verify every member against
  the retained transport, retain native source/structure in an isolated index,
  and recover every page with pinned OCR, physical text blocks and source-pixel
  table candidates. Tests reject dropped/invented members, altered primary or
  attachment bytes, changed source relationships and cross-filing index access.
  Primary index bytes survive; repeated native capture performs no new writes.
  Visually transcribed two headings and both complete responsibility statements
  from Anadolubank's one-page signed source for independent cloud comparisons.
  Cloud capture and related-document admin text access remain pending.

- 2026-09-06: completed all 1,146 registered native captures. Independently
  reconciled 1,144 expanded outcomes plus the two repaired source-bound archive
  acquisitions, totaling 119,772 pages. Every old source hash remains unchanged.
  Both repaired originals and all 175 retained pages match their official sources.
  Automatic recovery's live retained scope matches exactly 1,144 successful PDF
  hashes, with the two missing rows explicitly excluded and all four workers
  started; repair follow-ups follow separately. Full quality/origin reviews run.
- 2026-09-06: independently verified and published the separate one-page signed
  declaration: source/archive bytes, native image, OCR source pixels, 155 raw words
  and geometry, candidate layout and committed engine hashes. Two of four source
  regions match, while A.Ş./A.S. and ile/ve discrepancies remain explicit. Added
  an origin/member-bound admin reader and separate page/recovery access; unknown
  members, wrong archive/report bindings and corrupt receipts are rejected.
  Publication replay reuses raw OCR and leaves eight object versions, including
  the primary filing index, unchanged. The complete web suite passes 732 tests;
  live attachment-reader deployment checks remain pending.

- 2026-09-07: tightened the attachment reader after an independent mutation
  review: a valid parent-report revision substituted under an otherwise correct
  attachment relationship must fail. The reader now binds its PDF hash directly
  to the origin's raw member hash. Wrapped attachments need an explicit wrapper
  byte binding before admin access; the signed declaration is an ordinary PDF.

- 2026-09-07: all four current quality groups pass for 1,146 sources and 119,772
  pages; independently reconciled every PDF hash, copy and retained artifact.
  Native identities: 1,140 supported, three unresolved and three ambiguous.
  Visually inspected both scanned Kalkınma annual covers and the damaged-font
  Takasbank cover. Added three PDF/page/region-bound visual transcription reviews,
  separately labelled from native evidence; mutation checks reject changed pages,
  images, transcriptions, invalid regions and invented native references. The
  transcription itself remains a reviewer assertion. Cloud execution pending.
- 2026-09-07: live admin attachment view independently shows the 96-page primary
  report, separate one-page declaration, source links, eight OCR blocks and both
  A.S./A.Ş. and ve/ile disagreements. CI/deploy at `979b169` and 733 web tests pass.

- 2026-09-07: all three visual identity cloud reviews at `cbe9d3e` pass and match
  independently inspected original witnesses, registry and review engine hashes.
  CI `34061081094` and deploy `34061185039` pass; automatic unresolved findings
  remain explicit. No transcription claim is presented as native text evidence.
- 2026-09-07: visually reviewed QNB original pages 47–48 as a multi-page table
  case. The debt-instrument columns 1/2 continue under an explicit title despite
  changed widths. Added source-bound heading/header context, unambiguous grid
  spans and continuation candidates, preserving all cells and physical fragments.
  Tests reject swapped identifiers, missing markers/source words, intervening or
  competing tables, shifted/overlapping grid cells and changed context packets.
  The admin supports merged slots and prior-fragment navigation. A new independent
  continuation annotation fails on the old structure and passes on the new view;
  cloud capture/publication remain pending.

- 2026-09-07: QNB table-context cloud probe `34061799667` passes. Independent
  checks verify original bytes, all 108 retained pages, fresh source pages 47–48,
  five source annotations, context derived from the earlier retained structure
  and exact committed structure-engine hashes. Publication/live context pending.
- 2026-09-07: added read-only rendered-source review packs to the existing capture
  workflow. Each selected page has a named outcome and PDF/PNG/pixel/geometry
  binding. Whole-document rendering is limited to one filing in Actions; local
  probes remain at most four pages. No OCR or inferred text is used for the
  rendered originals. Tests cover rotation, exact pixels, changed source bytes,
  invalid/omitted selections and a middle-page failure followed by successful
  later rendering. Cloud whole-document preparation pending.
