# Docs index

Canonical documentation for the BDDK banking-data pipeline + dashboard.

**Reading order:** [README.md](../README.md) → [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
→ [PROJECT_STATE.md](PROJECT_STATE.md) → [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md).
Metric definitions live in [METRICS.md](METRICS.md).

## Core

| Doc | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) | End-to-end cloud stack: data flow, the two-lane workflow model, R2 snapshots, KV caching, the spine-table guard. |
| [PROJECT_STATE.md](PROJECT_STATE.md) | Snapshot of what's in the system **right now** — data coverage in D1, bank taxonomy, storage map, known issues. |
| [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) | Dated history of pipeline / dashboard changes (split out of PROJECT_STATE). |
| [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md) | How to run & maintain: the workflow schedule, manual recipes per lane, troubleshooting, disaster recovery. |
| [METRICS.md](METRICS.md) | Authoritative metric reference — sources (BDDK/EVDS/TBB/TEFAS/BIST/KAP), bank-type taxonomy, currency conventions, dashboard placements. |
| [BANKING_METRICS.md](BANKING_METRICS.md) | The 162-metric registry: what each metric means, how it's computed, and where it surfaces. |
| [ADMIN.md](ADMIN.md) | Setup & use of the `/admin` control center (coverage matrix, pipeline/traffic panels, auth, manual triggers). |
| [TELEGRAM_BOT.md](TELEGRAM_BOT.md) | The public Q&A bot: the agent loop, the read-only SQL gate, the grounding guard, setup, and the `bot-ask` test harness. |
| [ANALYST.md](ANALYST.md) | The analyst lane in plain language: detectors → assembly → story gates → LLM → guard, with diagrams, how to run it, and what is still switched off (cron + push are decisions, not blockers). |
| [ANALYST_V2.md](ANALYST_V2.md) | Analyst V2 (evaluation phase): agentic discovery over deterministic evidence — scout, typed read-only tools, structured claims, deterministic verifier. |
| [API.md](API.md) | The public `/api/v1` — technical reference for the EVDS-shaped series API (catalog, endpoints, licensing). |
| [API_MANUAL.md](API_MANUAL.md) | The public API's user manual: dataset/bank-type reference tables, worked examples, reading gotchas. |
| [SCHEMA_CONVENTIONS.md](SCHEMA_CONVENTIONS.md) | Naming rules for new D1 migrations (≥ 0022), enforced in CI by `scripts/check_schema_naming.py`. |

## Audit lane (per-bank BRSA report extraction)

| Doc | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [AUDIT_DOCUMENT_PLAN.md](AUDIT_DOCUMENT_PLAN.md) | Active complete-document corpus implementation: source identity, independent verification, structured tables/prose, durable storage and admin acceptance. Registered corpus first, then expansion. |
| [AUDIT_PIPELINE.md](AUDIT_PIPELINE.md) | How audit PDFs become D1 rows: the two-lane model, the statement-type registry, the repair playbook. |
| [AUDIT_EXTRACTION_GUIDE.md](AUDIT_EXTRACTION_GUIDE.md) | Checklist for writing / fixing a statement extractor (understand → identities → extract → validate → evidence → repair). |
| [AUDIT_BANK_CATALOG.md](AUDIT_BANK_CATALOG.md) | Auto-generated census of every bank × PDF: format profiles + per-bank filing quirks. |
| [MISSING_AUDIT_DATA.md](MISSING_AUDIT_DATA.md) | Partitions that can't be fixed from the inputs (image-only PDFs, absent filings, annual-only tables). |

## Agent tooling (`AGENTS.md` + `.claude/`)

The instruction files are `AGENTS.md` — at the repo root, in `web/` and in
`mobile/`. Each `CLAUDE.md` is a one-line `@AGENTS.md` import, so Claude Code and
the AGENTS.md-reading agents (opencode, Codex, …) read the same text. Edit the
`AGENTS.md`; the `CLAUDE.md` never carries content.

`.claude/` holds the Claude-Code-only extras — procedures that were previously
carried only in a session's head. Skills load themselves when the work matches
their description; commands are typed.

| Item | Kind | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` (root) | instructions | Orientation, the check commands, and the rules that are expensive to break (fitz-only, no `--force` re-extraction, D1 write cost, `null` ≠ `0`, and the 2026-08-03 reversal that lets a model set a figure — gates are per-lane now). |
| `web/AGENTS.md`, `mobile/AGENTS.md` | instructions | Per-surface layout, conventions and build traps. |
| `.claude/skills/audit-lane-fix/` | skill | Repairing a `bank_audit_*` lane: diagnosis before re-running, which workflow to dispatch, `only_failing` vs `force`, the override ordering. |
| `.claude/skills/evds-series/` | skill | Adding/debugging an EVDS macro series: the `SERIES` list, the two failure modes that still exit 0 (dead code after a rebase, CI read-timeout), the derivations with a right answer. |
| `.claude/skills/deep/` | skill | **Deep thinking** — conceptual/architectural questions about our own system: frame it, verify every load-bearing claim against the code, argue the opposite, then recommend. Produces an answer in chat and **writes no file**. The default; factual lookups stay fast. |
| `.claude/skills/research/` | skill | **Deep research** — wide investigation whose deliverable is a dated `docs/knowledge/` write-up: surveys, competitive scans, external-report evaluations. Fans out across repo and web. Needs an explicit ask; answers in chat first, then writes once. |
| `.claude/commands/newlane.md` | `/newlane` | End-to-end scaffold for a new lane — migration, ingest, validation, push path, chart-spec `verify` block, workflow, docs. |
| `.claude/commands/ship.md` | `/ship` | Runs the CI gate set locally, checks the docs that must move with the change, commits + pushes to `master`. |
| `.claude/agents/metric-finder.md` | agent | Identifies chart series in a source report and maps them to EVDS / local DB series. |

## Reference & history

| Doc | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [REPRODUCING_CHARTS.md](REPRODUCING_CHARTS.md) | The chart-spec creation + verification loop (catalog, schema, `verify_chart_spec.py`). |
| [regulation_followups.md](regulation_followups.md) | Tracking file for regulatory changes that need code updates. |
| [AUDIT_REWORK_PLAN.md](AUDIT_REWORK_PLAN.md) | **Historical** — the completed 6-phase audit-quality rework. |
| [RESUME_AUDIT_FIX.md](RESUME_AUDIT_FIX.md) | **Historical** — closure record of the 2026-06-12 balance-sheet ECL corruption fix. |
| `knowledge/` | **Internal — gitignored (2026-08-04), on-disk only.** Dated, status-marked working notes: strategic + architecture reviews, build plans, evaluations, external-report distillations. Not a data source for any page, and not part of the public repo. |
